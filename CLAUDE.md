# yenteclient — project conventions

Project-specific rules for working in this repo. The user's global
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` still applies — these are extensions or explicit choices
where this project deviates from defaults.

## Python target

- **Floor: Python 3.11.** Modern syntax is available natively; no compatibility
  shims for older versions.
- Develop on whatever's installed locally; CI matrix covers 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13.

## Imports

- **Absolute imports only.** No `from .foo import bar` anywhere in the package.
  Use `from yente_client.foo import bar`.
- Standard `isort` grouping: stdlib → third-party → first-party. Ruff enforces.
- Star imports are forbidden except in generated `__init__.py` files that
  re-export per-schema entity classes — those have `# noqa: F401, F403`.

## Typing

- **Modern PEP 604 / 585 syntax**: `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, `int | None`.
  No imports from `typing` for those — use the builtins. `typing.Optional`,
  `typing.Union`, `typing.List` etc. are not used.
- `Final`, `Literal`, `TypeAlias`, `ClassVar`, `Self`, `overload` — fine to use
  from `typing` when needed.
- `mypy --strict` must pass on `src/yente_client/`. New code that adds
  `# type: ignore` needs a code (`[attr-defined]` etc.) and a comment.
- **Do not add `from __future__ import annotations`** unless you have a
  concrete need (forward references, circular imports). Modern syntax works
  natively at 3.11; adding the future import everywhere causes subtle issues
  with Pydantic eval (we hit one in M2). If a file genuinely needs it, leave
  a comment saying why.

## Drift-prone facts

Never bake specific counts from the bundled FtM model into docstrings,
comments, plan docs, or `--help` output. **No** "69 schemas", "71 topics",
"20 property types", "3 genders" etc. — these all change when upstream
ships a new model snapshot and every reference becomes a small lie.

Acceptable forms:

- "every FtM schema" / "the full schema set"
- "the Topic enum (sourced from `model.types["topic"].values`)"
- "one class per FtM schema"
- Anchors that the model can't break: specific class names (`Person`,
  `Company`), specific topic strings (`"sanction"`, `"role.pep"`).

If a test needs to assert against the bundled model, check membership of
known anchors plus a sanity lower bound, never an exact count. The
`regen_model.py --check` CI step is the authoritative drift detector.

## Docstrings

Hybrid: Google-style structure, project-style content. The user's global rule
("lead with why, not how") wins on content; Google's sections give us a
consistent shape.

**Shape:**

1. **Imperative one-line summary.** `"Fetch a single entity by ID."` — not
   `"Fetches…"`.
2. **Why / when paragraph** (optional). One paragraph max. Hidden constraints,
   non-obvious motivation, "use this when…" guidance. Skip if the one-liner
   covers it.
3. **`Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:` sections** — *only when they add
   information beyond what the type annotations show*. Don't write `args: x
   (int): the x value` for a typed parameter; do write `Args:` when behaviour
   depends on a flag value, or when an argument has constraints that aren't
   in the type.

Private functions (leading underscore) get a one-line docstring or none —
spend effort on the public surface.

## Naming

- `snake_case` for functions, methods, variables, modules.
- `PascalCase` for classes (including generated entity classes).
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level constants (`BEST_ALGORITHM`).
- `_leading_underscore` for module-private (anything not exported).
- Double-leading-underscore name-mangling: avoid.
- **camelCase exception:** the per-schema entity classes (`Person`, `Company`)
  carry their FtM properties as `camelCase` fields (`firstName`, `birthDate`)
  to match the wire format. This is intentional and only applies to entity
  input classes. All other naming is snake_case.

## Errors

- Every project-raised error inherits from `YenteError` (defined in
  `yente_client.exceptions`).
- `pydantic.ValidationError` is raised separately for input-shape mistakes; we
  don't wrap or alias it.
- Wrap external errors with `raise NewError(...) from exc` to preserve context.
- Don't catch `Exception` broadly. Catch what you know how to handle.

## Logging

- **Stdlib `logging`** when M4+ work introduces logging.
- Module-level logger: `log = logging.getLogger(__name__)` at the top of the
  file (after imports).
- The SDK should be quiet by default. Callers configure handlers / levels.
- Don't log inside hot paths or per-request unless gated on debug level.

## Custom exceptions

- Defined in `yente_client/exceptions.py`.
- `YenteError` is the only base class for client-raised errors.
- Subclasses carry structured attributes (status_code, retry_after, etc.) in
  addition to the message — caller can branch on type or read fields.

## File / module layout

- `src/yente_client/` package layout. Tests under `python/tests/` at the
  repo root (not inside the package).
- Public surface is re-exported from `yente_client/__init__.py`.
- Generated files: `_generated.py` and `_literals.py` carry `# ruff: noqa` at
  the top and are produced by `scripts/regen_model.py`. Don't hand-edit.
- Files can grow as long as they're cohesive. If `client.py` crosses 500
  lines, consider splitting endpoints into a submodule. We're under that
  ceiling today.

## Tests

- `pytest` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
  `async def test_*` works without per-test decorators.
- Fixtures live in `python/tests/conftest.py`. Shared: `load_fixture`,
  `make_client`, `make_async_client`, `live_client`, `live_async_client`.
- **`@pytest.mark.live`** for tests that hit a real yente; gated on
  `OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY`. Run locally via `pytest -m live`; CI splits them
  into a separate job.
- Mock HTTP via `httpx.MockTransport(handler)` passed through the `transport=`
  kwarg on `Client` / `AsyncClient`. We don't use `respx` despite having it
  installed.
- Fixtures (JSON response bodies) live in **`testdata/` at the repo root**,
  not in `python/tests/fixtures/` — shared with the future TS SDK.
- Prefer separate test functions over `@pytest.mark.parametrize` when the
  cases are conceptually different. Parametrize when you're varying one input
  and the assertions are identical (e.g. `test_invalid_app_name_raises[bad]`).

## Codegen

- `scripts/regen_model.py` fetches the FtM model from
  `data.opensanctions.org/meta/model.json`, writes `model/model.json`, copies
  to the package, renders Jinja templates, and runs `ruff format` as a
  postprocess.
- Determinism rules: schemas alphabetical, properties alphabetical, JSON
  written with `sort_keys=True`, compact separators, trailing newline.
- CI runs `regen_model.py --check --skip-fetch` to detect drift between the
  templates and the committed generated files.
- **Never hand-edit generated files.** Update the template, run regen, commit.

## Working in this repo

- Project-local venv at `python/.venv/`. System Python 3.14 lacks
  `ensurepip`, so we create it via `uv venv` and install via
  `uv pip install --python python/.venv/bin/python -e python[dev]`.
- `make setup` / `make regen-model` / `make regen-model-check` / `make test` /
  `make lint`. CI runs the underlying commands directly.
- `.env` at repo root (gitignored) carries `OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY` and
  `YENTE_BASE_URL`. Conftest loads it for local convenience.
- Don't commit secrets. Don't push without explicit user direction (per the
  global CLAUDE.md pacing rules).
