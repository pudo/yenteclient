# Get started with the yente-client Python SDK

A linear walk through the SDK: install → first match → matching in depth →
fetch → search → async → errors → entities. If you want shell access
rather than Python, see the [CLI overview](cli.md) instead.

## 1. Install and authenticate

```bash
pip install yente-client
```

Python 3.11+. Runtime dependencies are `pydantic` and `httpx`.

The hosted [OpenSanctions API](https://www.opensanctions.org/account/)
needs an API key. Get one, then export it:

```bash
export OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY=sk_live_…
```

A bare `Client()` constructor picks up `OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY` and
`YENTE_BASE_URL` from the environment. To target your own self-hosted
yente instance, set `YENTE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000` (or pass
`base_url=` directly).

```python
from yente_client import Client

with Client() as client:
    print(client.healthz())
    # StatusResponse(status='ok')
```

`Client` is a context manager — use `with Client() as client:` for
deterministic cleanup of the underlying `httpx.Client`.

## 2. Your first match

The SDK's primary use case is **matching**: given a partial or complete
entity description, find candidate matches in OpenSanctions data.

### Construct an entity

Every FtM schema has a Python class. Construct one with the property
fields you know:

```python
from yente_client import Client, Person

query = Person(
    firstName="Vladimir",
    lastName="Putin",
    birthDate="1952-10-07",
)
```

Property names are FtM **camelCase** — `firstName`, `birthDate`,
`nationality`, `passportNumber` — matching the wire format. Use
[`yente-cli ref schema Person`](cli.md) (or the
[`Person` API reference](api/entities.md)) to discover what properties
each schema accepts.

### Run the match

```python
with Client() as client:
    response = client.match(query, datasets=["sanctions"])
```

The SDK issues **one HTTP request per `match()` call**. Bulk workflows
(matching N entities concurrently) get their own surface in a later
release; for now wrap `match()` in a loop or in `asyncio.gather` (see
section 6).

### Read the response

`match()` returns a flat `MatchResponse`:

```python
print(response.total.value)        # candidate count
print(response.top)                # highest-scoring result, or None
for hit in response.matches:        # results that crossed the threshold
    print(hit.score, hit.caption, hit.datasets)
```

Each result is a `ScoredEntity` carrying:

- `score` — float in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- `match` — `True` when `score >= threshold` (defaults to 0.70).
- `caption` — display name from the server.
- `explanations` — per-feature score breakdown (which features fired,
  what their weights were).
- All the usual FtM properties under `entity.properties`.

See [`MatchResponse`](api/models.md) and [`ScoredEntity`](api/models.md)
for the full shape.

## 3. Matching in depth

### The threshold

By default the server returns candidates above `score=0.7` in `matches`,
but the full result set comes back regardless — `results` carries every
candidate the server considered, scored. Lower the threshold to inspect
near-misses:

```python
response = client.match(query, threshold=0.5)
```

### Choosing an algorithm

The server exposes several scoring algorithms. `BEST_ALGORITHM` resolves
to whichever the server currently recommends — pass it for
forward-compatibility:

```python
from yente_client import BEST_ALGORITHM

response = client.match(query, algorithm=BEST_ALGORITHM)
```

Use `client.algorithms()` to see what's enabled on the target server.

### Narrowing with MatchFilters

Filters constrain which candidates the server considers. Pass them as
kwargs or as a `MatchFilters` object:

```python
from yente_client import MatchFilters

response = client.match(query, datasets=["sanctions"], topics=["sanction"])
# or
filters = MatchFilters(datasets=["sanctions"], topics=["sanction"])
response = client.match(query, filters=filters)
```

When both are supplied, the kwargs win on any field they specify.
[`MatchFilters`](api/filters.md) lists every available field.

### Schema-level matchable: the SDK refuses non-matchable schemas

Yente refuses `/match` queries against non-matchable schemas
(`Document`, `Article`, `Vehicle`, …). The SDK preempts this client-side
and raises `ConfigurationError` before the round-trip:

```python
from yente_client import Document
from yente_client.exceptions import ConfigurationError

try:
    client.match(Document(fileName="x.pdf"))
except ConfigurationError as exc:
    print(exc)
    # Schema 'Document' is not a matchable target for /match. …
```

Use `yente-cli ref schemas --matchable` (or
[`is_matchable_schema()`](api/schemas.md)) to find valid targets.

### Property-level: "directly scored" is a narrow signal

Per-property `matchable` in the FtM model marks properties that
contribute to a match score as a **primary** matching feature. Properties
without it can still meaningfully impact match results — sending them is
generally fine and often helpful:

- **Name parts** (`firstName`, `middleName`, `lastName`, `fatherName`, …)
  get folded into a synthesized `name` value if no name is set.
- **`weakAlias` / `abbreviation`** are cross-compared against candidate
  names during scoring.
- **`gender`** acts as a mismatch penalty — disagreement lowers the
  score.

The `directly_scored` flag shown in `yente-cli ref schema NAME` reflects
the model's per-property flag (with type-level defaulting). Treat it as
"primary scoring input?" — not "useful?".

## 4. Fetch and adjacency

Given an entity ID — typically from a match result, search hit, or an
external system — fetch the full record:

```python
entity = client.fetch("NK-aU5ybkbRFJucf8YMwsJvDw")
print(entity.caption, entity.schema_)
print(entity.properties.get("topics"))
```

### Nested vs flat

`fetch()` returns nested entities by default (when properties reference
other entities, those are expanded inline). Pass `nested=False` for the
flat shape — useful in data pipelines where you don't want to recurse:

```python
flat = client.fetch(entity_id, nested=False)
```

### Adjacent entities

The adjacency endpoint exposes paged neighbours by property name:

```python
# All adjacencies, grouped by property:
adj = client.adjacent(entity_id)
for prop, page in adj.adjacent.items():
    print(prop, page.total.value)

# One property at a time, with paging:
page = client.adjacent(entity_id, prop="familyRelative", limit=10, offset=0)
for ent in page.results:
    print(ent.caption)
```

See [`AdjacentResponse`](api/models.md) and
[`AdjacentPropertyResponse`](api/models.md).

## 5. Search (for user-facing search UIs)

`search()` is a **different use case** from matching. Reach for it when
you're building an end-user search experience — autocomplete fields,
browse pages, search-this-database forms where a human is typing into
the input.

For any matching task — including those with very partial input — use
`match()`. `search()` is not a fallback for incomplete data.

```python
results = client.search("acme", datasets=["default"], schema="Company")
for entity in results.results:
    print(entity.caption, entity.id)
```

`search()` returns plain `Entity` objects (no score, no match flag). Use
[`SearchFilters`](api/filters.md) for the full filter shape (countries,
schema, free-text `filter:` clauses, facets).

## 6. Async

`AsyncClient` mirrors `Client` method-for-method. Use it when running
many requests concurrently — the network is the bottleneck, and async
lets one event loop juggle hundreds of in-flight requests.

```python
import asyncio
from yente_client import AsyncClient, Person

async def screen_all(queries: list[Person]) -> list:
    async with AsyncClient() as client:
        return await asyncio.gather(
            *(client.match(q, datasets=["sanctions"]) for q in queries)
        )

responses = asyncio.run(screen_all([
    Person(firstName="Alex", lastName="Smith"),
    Person(firstName="Maria", lastName="Garcia"),
]))
```

`async with` handles cleanup; `await client.aclose()` is the manual form.
See [`AsyncClient`](api/async_client.md).

## 7. Errors

Every error raised by this client inherits from `YenteError`. The tree:

```
YenteError
├── ConfigurationError      # bad client config, non-matchable schema, …
├── TransportError          # network, timeout, TLS
└── APIError                # non-2xx response
    ├── AuthenticationError # 401, 403
    ├── BadRequestError     # 400
    ├── NotFoundError       # 404
    ├── RateLimitError      # 429 (carries .retry_after)
    └── ServerError         # 5xx
```

Catch by category when you want to handle a class of failure:

```python
from yente_client.exceptions import APIError, TransportError

try:
    response = client.match(query)
except RateLimitError as exc:
    sleep(exc.retry_after or 5)
except APIError as exc:
    log.error("server said %s: %s", exc.status_code, exc.detail)
except TransportError:
    # The request never reached the server.
    raise
```

Input-shape errors (typo in a property name, wrong value type) surface
as `pydantic.ValidationError` — we don't wrap or alias it.

Retries are **not** built in. The client raises; callers handle backoff.
See [`exceptions`](api/exceptions.md) for full per-class details.

## 8. Entities and the FtM model

The per-schema input classes (`Person`, `Company`, `Vessel`, …) are
generated from a bundled snapshot of the FtM model. Field names match
the wire format exactly (camelCase).

### Discovering schemas at runtime

```python
from yente_client.schemas import has_schema, iter_properties, matchable_schemata

has_schema("Person")             # True
list(iter_properties("Person"))  # ['abbreviation', 'address', …, 'weight']
matchable_schemata()             # ['Address', 'Airplane', 'Company', …]
```

The same data is available via the CLI:

```bash
yente-cli ref schemas --matchable
yente-cli ref schema Person
```

See [`schemas`](api/schemas.md) for the full lookup helper set.

### Updating the bundled model

The model is a *snapshot* — pinned at SDK-release time. Properties added
upstream don't appear until the next SDK release. Maintainers run
`make regen-model` to refresh.
