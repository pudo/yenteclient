"""Filter types for ``/match`` and ``/search``.

Two public types share a small private base so each endpoint method
accepts only the filter shape that makes sense for it. ``extra="forbid"``
turns cross-endpoint typos (passing ``countries=`` to ``match()``, etc.)
into immediate ``pydantic.ValidationError``.

Aliases for ``schema`` and ``filter`` exist because those names are
reserved (Python builtin / Pydantic-sensitive); ``populate_by_name=True``
means callers can write either ``schema=...`` (the alias) or
``schema_=...`` (the Python field name) and both work.
